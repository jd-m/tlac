* Why this blog?
The bible is full of treasure. And not just any treasure, but eternal treasure (the best kind). In the bible I've found things that have been encouraging, sobering, awe-inspiring, thought-provoking, surprising, and truly transformational. This blog is mainly a place to share things which I hope will lead you to be amazed by the God who has chosen to reveal himself to us in the pages of his word.

* About the author
My name is Jaiden. I am a Christian. I live in London and am grateful to be part of a bible-believing church that seeks know Jesus and make him known. I also work as a secondary school math teacher. Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God (Acts 14:22).
